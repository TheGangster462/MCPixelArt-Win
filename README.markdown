MCPixelArt (Windows)
====================

MCPixelArt is a utility for Windows used to create [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net) `.schematic` files from image files. These schematics can be imported using [MCEdit](https://github.com/mcedit/mcedit).

You can also download just the app `.exe`, which is hosted [here](http://daltonclaybrook.com/mcpixelart).
